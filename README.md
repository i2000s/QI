***Note***: This project has mainly been moved to the [ICIQ community project](https://github.com/ICIQ/iciq.github.io). Therefore, this repository is no longer under active development.

QI-Project
==
This is an open-source project aiming at facilitating collaborations and creativities in the field of quantum information, quantum computing and quantum artificial intelligence. It is expected to have a website linking with discussions, documentations and maybe some implements of algorithms. Here is the source code for the website and the repository for related projects.

Now, the project is at alpha-phase.

Welcome to fork and pull requests. Suggestions on building projects and websites for quantum information, quantum computing and quantum artificial intelligence are highly appreciated. 

Branches of Repositories
==
The source code of the project website is in the gh-pages branch. The master branch is mainly used as a repository for the next version of webpages and related open-source projects. The changes of the master branch does not affect the outlook of the project website. 

HTML
==
Just edit the HTML files in the gh-pages branch, and pull your request to the repository. You can start a community discussion by commit an issue (see the GitHub link on your right), but pull request has a higher priority over issues. Changes on the gh-pages branch will be reflected at http://i2000s.github.io/QI within 10 min. 

Recent focuses
==
1. Build a functional platform that everyone (most non-website developers) can easily contribute ideas and scientific references on our website. Currently, we are using Docear or Freeplane as a tool to export mindmaps as a HTML page. This is neither reversible nor sufficient for our need.
2. Looking for nominations of open-source projects that we should support and use for our present researches in this field. You can start an issue discussion so that every contributor and watcher of this project can receive an email and take actions (see, another technical problem looking for better solutions). All nominated existing open-source projects will be linked in a summary page. All wanted open-source projects will be reflected in the project Roadmap page.
3. Looking for contributors who would like to better this website and initialize associate meaningful open-source projects.
4. Looking for project sponsors so that we can afford a web-server to launch a better database and website service. 

Cheers!
